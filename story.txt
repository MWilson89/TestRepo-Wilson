It was a quaint tuesday, deep into the night, I was sitting alone playing Super Mario Sunshine. The clock struck 11 PM when my state of serenity came to a sudden halt. I stood up, the sound of my crackers hitting the floor echoed throughout the room when I came to the sudden realization. I had forgotten to do my Make and JUnit Activity. I knew I wouldn't be able to fully complete it in one hour, because I'm trash at command line activities. My heart sank deep down as I realized: all hope was lost.
I scrambled to pull up the canvas page, reading through the assignment quickly, skipping nearly every other word. I opened my VM. I looked up how to ssh. I created a new MakeFile. I added new make commands. I included their dependencies. Hey, I'm getting the hang of this! Before I knew it, it was 11:30, and I hadn't yet finished up the Make assignment...
